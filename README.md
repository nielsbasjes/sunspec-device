# What is this?
The Modbus Schema of a SunSpec device depends on the device itself.
Even a software upgrade can and will change the Modbus Schema.

This SunSpec specific library combines discovering the SunSpec models in a specific device with the officially published SunSpec models to generate the Modbus Schema automatically.

# Modbus Schema Toolkit
This is part of the Modbus Schema Toolkit I ([Niels Basjes](https://niels.basjes.nl)) created that makes retrieving data from Modbus based devices a lot easier.

I have split this into 3 projects:
- [Modbus Schema](https://github.com/nielsbasjes/modbus-schema):
  - A toolkit and schema definition
  - [![License](https://img.shields.io/:license-apache-blue.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

# License
I'm publishing this under the Apache 2.0 license because I believe this can be part of making this planet a bit more in control of the energy consumption.
I also believe that making this open for all to use is the best way to achieve this.

But do not underestimate how much work went into this. From my first attempts to releasing the first version took me about 5 years of spending my spare time.

So what I want to see in return is a little bit of gratitude from the people who use this.
If you are a home user/hobbyist/small business then a simple star on the projects you use is enough for me. Seeing that people use and like the things I create is what I'm doing this for.
What also really helps are bug reports, dumps from real devices I do not have and discussions on things you think can be done better.

Despite there not being any obligation (because of the Apache 2.0 license); If you are a big corporation where my code really adds value to the products you make/sell then I would really appreciate it if you could do a small sponsor thing. Buy me lunch (€10), Buy me a game (€100) or what ever you think is the right way to say thank you for the work I have done.
