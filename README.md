# Modbus Schema Toolkit
This toolkit is intended to make retrieving data from Modbus based devices a lot easier.

I have split this into 3 projects:
- [Modbus Schema](https://github.com/nielsbasjes/modbus-schema): A toolkit and schema definition
- [Modbus Devices](https://github.com/nielsbasjes/modbus-devices): The actual schemas of a few devices.
- [SunSpec Device](https://github.com/nielsbasjes/sunspec-device): The schema for a SunSpec device differs per physical device

The documentation can be found here https://modbus.basjes.nl/

All of this was created by [Niels Basjes](https://niels.basjes.nl/).

# What is this?
Sunspec is really a meta-schema for specific modbus devices where you retrieve the actual set of schema blocks that are present on the device.

This Sunspec specific library inspects the actual device and generates the schema for that specific device on the fly at startup.
